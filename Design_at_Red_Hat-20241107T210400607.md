## MANY VOICES, ONE RED HAT

### Open design creates better experiences

Red Hatters believe in transparency, collaboration, and inclusion. These principles aren’t just for creating technology — they shape how we design, too.

## HOW WE WORK

Open design is built on collaboration. It's a conversation between diverse voices. It's about listening to what our community needs, taking that feedback, and creating systems that work together, across teams and contexts.

Open design creates helpful and accessible experiences for real people.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Collaboration is built on shared principles

To keep us aligned and working towards a shared vision, we have design principles. Our principles are the fundamentals that build a strong foundation for open design to thrive.

### Start intentionally
Identify the problem well before you start to solve it. Know why you’re designing. If you don’t, ask questions to gain insights. Those answers will lead to better questions or new directions.

### Lean on research
Know who you’re designing for and what they need; talk to them if you can. When you understand their motivations, you’re able to demonstrate real empathy for the user, and the most impactful choices become clear.
